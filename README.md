# MY FINAL PROJECT 
This is a web-based juice shop application that allows users to register, login, browse juices, add them to a cart, and place orders. The new feature implemented is a complete e-commerce shopping cart system with persistent storage of user orders on the server side and client-side cart management using localStorage.
## Prerequisites 
Flask (pip install flask)

## Project Checklist
 - [X] It is available on GitHub. 
 - [X] It uses the Flask web framework. 
 - [X] It uses at least one module from the Python Standard Library other than the random module. 
  
  - Module name: Module name: os, json, datetime
  - [X] It contains at least one class written by you that has 
both properties and methods. It uses `__init__()` to let the 
class initialize the object's attributes (note that  
`__init__()` doesn't count as a method). This includes 
instantiating the class and using the methods in your app. 
Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of 
at least one example of a class definition in your code as 
well as the names of two properties and two methods. 
  - File name for the class definition: juice_shop.py
  - Line number(s) for the class definition: 4-82
  - Name of two properties: users, juices
  - Name of two methods: register_user, authenticate_user
  - File name and line numbers where the methods are used: app.py lines 17, 24
  - [X] It makes use of JavaScript in the front end and uses the localStorage of the web browser.
  - [X] It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const rather than var). 
  - [X] It makes use of the reading and writing to the same file feature.
  - [X] It contains conditional statements. Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of at least 
 one example of a conditional statement in your code. 
  - File name:  app.py
  - Line number(s): 15-18 (login route conditional)
  - [X] It contains loops. Please provide below the file name and the line number(s) of at least 
  one example of a loop in your code. 
  - File name: juice_shop.py
  - Line number(s): 22-30 (loop through user data file)
  - [X] It lets the user enter a value in a text box at some point. 
  This value is received and processed by your back end 
Python code.
  - [X] It doesn't generate any error message even if the user enters a wrong input.
  - [X] It is styled using your own CSS.
  - [X] The code follows the code and style conventions as introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments 
and doesn't contain unused or experimental code.  
  In particular, the code should not use `print()` or 
`console.log()` for any information the app user should see. 
Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the 
browser.
